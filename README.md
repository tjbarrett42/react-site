## Reflection

This was a recreation of my old personal website that used HTML, CSS, Javascript and JSX.

I've used `react-router-dom`) in class projects before and the single-page application is far more clean to edit and maintain.

This project started with the `create-react-app` boilerplate, added `react-router-dom` and went from there.

Future plans include hooking up a weather API for a dynamic background (perhaps from a ski resort location!) or adding a few more animations in between different routes.
